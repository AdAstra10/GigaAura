This pull request migrates the application from Firebase to PostgreSQL. The migration includes:

1. Added PostgreSQL environment variables in .env.local
2. The application now uses PostgreSQL as the primary database
3. Cloudflare KV configuration is kept for backward compatibility but is no longer required

PostgreSQL Database Configuration:
- Host: dpg-cvmv93k9c44c73blmoag-a.oregon-postgres.render.com
- Database: gigaaura_storage
- User: gigaaura_storage_user
- Port: 5432

All Firebase references have been removed from the codebase.
